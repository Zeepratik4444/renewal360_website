    outcome: "Know which accounts are actually at risk — not just who hasn't replied in a while",
    desc: "Scores every account across Engagement Health, Sentiment & Value Realisation, Relationship Depth, Financial Health, and Renewal Momentum. Weights shift dynamically as the renewal date approaches — so a T-7 account and a T-90 account are scored differently.",

    name: "Smart Milestone Sequences",
    persona: "CSM",
    outcome: "Every account gets the right email at the right time — automatically",
    desc: "Sequences fire at proportional milestones (25%, 16%, 8%, and 2% of term remaining) rather than fixed day counts — so monthly and annual accounts both get appropriately timed outreach. Four email types: check-in, renewal discussion, renewal reminder, urgent reminder.",

    name: "Human Approval Queue",
    persona: "CSM + RevOps",
    outcome: "AI drafts every email. Your team reviews, edits, approves — or skips. Nothing goes out blind.",
    desc: "Every pending email lands in your approval queue with one-click Send, Edit, or Skip. High-value at-risk accounts trigger an Escalate decision, creating a CSM task and pausing automation — so your team handles the relationship when it matters most.",

    icon: "😊",
    name: "NPS Survey System",
    persona: "CSM + Exec",
    outcome: "Catch unhappy customers before they decide not to renew",
    desc: "Build and schedule NPS surveys via the survey builder. Auto-triggered at T-45 days before renewal, 7 days post-onboarding, and after support ticket resolution. Promoter scores reduce risk level; Detractor scores (0–6) flag accounts immediately and alert the CSM.",

    name: "Revenue at Risk Dashboard",
    persona: "Executive",
    outcome: "Answer 'how much ARR is at risk this quarter?' in one glance",
    desc: "Real-time pipeline broken down by High / Medium / Healthy risk with dollar values, not just account counts. 6-month renewal forecast, CSM leaderboard by ARR saved, and KPI cards for total ARR, upcoming renewals, and team response rates.",

    name: "CRM & Email Integrations",
    persona: "RevOps",
    outcome: "Works with your existing stack — no ripping and replacing",
    desc: "Bi-directional sync with Salesforce, HubSpot, and Zendesk. IMAP monitoring reads incoming customer replies to detect sentiment and trigger sequence pauses automatically. Slack webhooks push at-risk alerts and slash-command summaries to your CS channel.",
